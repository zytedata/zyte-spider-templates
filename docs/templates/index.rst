Spider templates

Built-in `spider templates`_ use `Zyte API automatic extraction`_ to provide
automatic crawling and parsing, i.e. you can run these spiders on any website
of the right type to automatically extract the desired structured data.

For example, to extract all products from an e-commerce website, you can run
the :ref:`e-commerce spider <e-commerce>` spider as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

    scrapy crawl ecommerce -a url="https://books.toscrape.com"

Spider templates support additional parameters beyond ``url``. See the
documentation of each specific spider for details.

You can also :ref:`customize spider templates <customization>` to meet your
needs.
